# getserverdata
### What it does 
Well, it doesn't do much, but here you go:

* Sets up a Python HTTP server that allows CORS 
* Generate the directory (server) structure in an XML file 
* Request the XML using JavaScript and display in browser

See told you it doesn't do much...

### How to test this thing
Simple:
* Run server 
    ```bash
    python3 server.py
    ```
That's about it. The page is rendered using the ``index.html``, as it should be by default. So the scripts are automatically run.
